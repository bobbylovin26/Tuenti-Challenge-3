# Tuenti Programming Challenge 3
_From April 29th to May 6th 2013_


These are all the files and solutions used by [@shoghicp](https://twitter.com/shoghicp) and submitted to the contest.

#### To run these solutions, you'll need:
* PHP >= 5.4 with BCMath and [pthreads](https://github.com/krakjoe/pthreads)
 * [PHP Windows binaries](http://bit.ly/14j6jTO).
 * Create the `bin` subfolder and move the files there.

After that, to run a solution, in the command line, use `bin/php FILE.php`.
